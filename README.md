The main idea for this project is to display images about reptiles, and inform the visitors about reptiles.
Users can browse through the site gaining knowledge about reptiles through text, video and some audio.


# UX

The primary targets are people who like reptiles.
New and old fans are welcome to browse through the site and get to know some of the most popular reptiles.
